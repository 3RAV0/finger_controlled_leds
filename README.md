# Gesture-Controlled LED Illumination with Python and Arduino

This project features an hand-tracking system developed using Python and Arduino. By processing images captured from a camera, the system determines the number of open fingers on the hand and utilizes this information to control LEDs through Arduino. For instance, if there are five open fingers, five LEDs will light up. This project combines image processing, serial communication, and simple electronic integration to provide a hands-on experience based on hand gestures.
